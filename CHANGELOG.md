# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

## [2.6.0] - 2019-10-23
### Added
- TIFF and BMP support.
- `IMGPROXY_REPORT_DOWNLOADING_ERRORS` config. Setting it to `false` disables reporting of downloading errors.
- SVG passthrough. When source image and requested format are SVG, image will be returned without changes.
- `IMGPROXY_USE_GCS` config. When it set to true and `IMGPROXY_GCS_KEY` is not set, imgproxy tries to use Application Default Credentials to get access to GCS bucket.

### Changed
- Reimplemented and more errors-tolerant image size parsing.
- Log only modified processing options.

### Fixed
- Fixed sharpening+watermarking.
- Fixed path parsing when no options is provided and image URL is Base64 encoded.

### Deprecated

- Using `IMGPROXY_GCS_KEY` without `IMGPROXY_USE_GCS` set to `true` is deprecated.

## [2.5.0] - 2019-09-19
### Added
- `structured` and `json` log formats. Can be set with `IMGPROXY_LOG_FORMAT`.

### Changed
- New default log format.
- Better watermarking: image transparency doesn't affect watermarks, faster watermark scaling.

## [2.4.1] - 2019-08-29
### Changed
- More verbose URL parsing errors.

## [2.4.0] - 2019-08-20
### Added
- `SO_REUSEPORT` socker option support. Can be enabled with `IMGPROXY_SO_REUSEPORT`.
- [filename](./docs/generating_the_url_advanced.md#filename) option.

### Changed
- Better handling if non-sRGB images.
- `dpr` option always changes the resulting size even if it leads to enlarge and `enlarge` is falsey.
- Log to STDOUT.
- Only unexpected errors are reported to Bugsnag/Honeybadger/Sentry.
- Better Sentry support.

### Deprecated
- GZip compression support is deprecated.

## [2.3.0] - 2019-06-25
### Added
- `libvips` v8.8 support: better processing of animated GIFs, built-in CMYK profile, better WebP scale-on-load, etc;
- Animated WebP support. `IMGPROXY_MAX_GIF_FRAMES` is deprecated, use `IMGPROXY_MAX_ANIMATION_FRAMES`;
- [HEIC support](./docs/image_formats_support.md#heic-support);
- [crop](./docs/generating_the_url_advanced.md#crop) processing option. `resizing_type:crop` is deprecated;
- Offsets for [gravity](./docs/generating_the_url_advanced.md#gravity);
- Resizing type `auto`. If both source and resulting dimensions have the same orientation (portrait or landscape), imgproxy will use `fill`. Otherwise, it will use `fit`;
- Development errors mode. When `IMGPROXY_DEVELOPMENT_ERRORS_MODE` is true, imgproxy will respond with detailed error messages. Not recommended for production because some errors may contain stack trace;
- `IMGPROXY_KEEP_ALIVE_TIMEOUT` config.

### Changed
- Allow URL query for `/health`;
- Better stack trace for image processing errors;

## [2.2.13] - 2019-05-07
