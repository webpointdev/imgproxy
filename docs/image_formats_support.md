# Image formats support

At the moment, imgproxy supports only the most popular Web image formats:

* PNG;
* JPEG;
* WebP;
* GIF.

## GIF support

imgproxy supports GIF output only when using libvips 8.7.0+ compiled with ImageMagick support. Official imgproxy Docker image supports GIF out of the box.
